// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// 1.Planning
// 2.Analysis of Requirements
// 3.Design
// 4.Implementation
// 5.Testing & Integration
// 6.Maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning =
  "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added.";
const analysisOfRequirements =
  "Defining requirements is considered part of planning to determine what the program or project is supposed to do and its requirements. ";
const design =
  "The Design phase models the way a software application will work. Some aspects of design include: architecture, ui, platforms, programming, communications, security.";
const implementation = "This is the actual writing or creation of the program.";
const testingAndIntegration =
  "It’s critical to test an application before making it available to users. Much of the testing can be automated, like security testing.";
const maintain =
  "In this phase, users discover bugs that weren’t found during testing. These errors need to be resolved, which can spawn new development cycles.";
